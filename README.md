I’m thrilled to present my latest dashboard, which offers a comprehensive analysis of key HR metrics: Presence Percentage, Work From Home Percentage, and Sick Leave Percentage from April to June. This dashboard is designed for simplicity, allowing stakeholders to quickly grasp essential insights at a granular level.

Key Takeaways from My Project:

Data Cleaning: I utilized techniques like 'unpivot columns', parameters, and functions to efficiently transform our data.

Data Visualization: I focused on selecting the most effective visualizations to clearly convey metrics, trends, and seasonalities.

Data Analysis: I explored patterns within the data to identify potential cause-and-effect relationships.

Key Conclusions:

An upward trend in sick leave percentage was observed from April to June, likely influenced by seasonal changes.

Conversely, there’s a downward trend in presence percentage, indicating that more employees are opting to work from home as the months progress.

Presence percentage peaks on Mondays, while Fridays see the highest rates of remote work.
